# CHOIR_Chen_et_al_2017_Comparison

üîç Revisiting Hypothalamic Cell Diversity with CHOIR

This project re-analyzes Chen et al. (2017) adult mouse hypothalamus single-cell RNA-seq data using CHOIR (Cluster Hierarchy Optimization by Iterative Random forests). By refining cell clustering, CHOIR reveals potential subtypes within oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), offering new insights into brain cell diversity. Includes scripts for preprocessing, CHOIR clustering, visualization, and downstream exploration.
